# 🧠 Product Recommendation System (ML.NET)

A **machine learning-based recommendation system** built with **ML.NET** using the **Matrix Factorization** algorithm.  
It predicts user preferences and recommends products based on historical interaction data.  
The model can be retrained dynamically as new user-product interactions are added.
